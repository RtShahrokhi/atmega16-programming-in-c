# atmega16-programming-in-c & proteus 8 professional
University Project
This is atmega16 programming in c project 
all codes are compiled in codevision
hardware simulation with : proteus 8 professional

this project includes 3 parts :
Part 1:
A traffic light in such a way that the lights turn red, yellow, green, yellow, red, respectively, with an interval of one second, and if the light is red and the Button 
Push is pressed, a continuous beep will be produced.

part 2:
2.1: 
Two-digit seconds counter, using 7Segment
2.2:
Counter alarm beeps for one second during the 10th sec, 20th sec, 30th sec and ...
2.3:
Button Push: changes counting direction  from ascending to descending

part 3 :
For this part four 7Segments and also a 7-channel Dip switch is used.
(Note: At any given time, only one of the keys should be on and the rest should be off.)
Project Description:
1) If only key 1 is activated: the project becomes a 2-digit counter. If you press the increase button, the number = number+1 .
And if you press the decrease button, the number = number-1 .
2) If only key 2 is activated: show the word (HELL) .
3) If only key 3 is activated: ascending counter from 0 to 9999 .
4) If only key 4 is activated: descending counter from 9999 to 0 .
5) If only key 5 is activated: passing the mobile number
